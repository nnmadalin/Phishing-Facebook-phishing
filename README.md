# Phishing-Facebook-
With this you can "lure" people, adding the login data from facebook in your application. Then, with the help of the script.py file we will check if that account exists in the facebook database. If the account exists, a certain variable in our database will change, redirecting the user to a pre-established link. If the account does not exist, the error message will be displayed on the phishing page!

> For everything to work, the login data from the database must be added to the ~ conectare.php ~ and ~ script.py ~ files!
